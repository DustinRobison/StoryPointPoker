<h1 align="center">Story Point Poker</h1>

<div align="center">

[Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) tool for sharing task complexity estimates.

</div>

## Pre Requisites
- [Node v10+/NPM v6+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Firebase Environment](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Installation
> I was planing to allow use of storypointpoker.com backend but it turned out to be a financial risk so you need to create your own firebase environment
1. Clone the repository and change directory into the project root

    `git clone git@github.com:DustinRobison/StoryPointPoker.git && cd StoryPointPoker`
    
2. Install the dependencies with node package manager

    `npm i`

3. Run the app in development mode at default `http://localhost:3000`
    
    `npm start`
    
4. Get your [firebase web configuration](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) 


## About
This project is hosted by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).  
You cannot use the current server infrastructure because of an exploit risk, but it is free to setup your own firebase environment for working on front end features. 

This is a simple site that I did as a one night hacking session after being frustrated with currently available free tools.  Since then I have cleaned it up a little and added a few features but not much.

If interested PR's will be reviewed and accepted as promptly as possible.

_____
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
